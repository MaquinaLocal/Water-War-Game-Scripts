"Water War" is a duck hunting type game created as a final project for an advanced C++ programming course in Unreal Engine.

In this repository I've put together the principal game scripts, that way you can easily take a snap to the programming behind the game.

List of content:
  - Character > "Pistol Character" is the main player's script. "Projectile Base" is the script for the spawned projectile.
  - Enemy > "Enemy Base" is the script for the boy in the red cap (player's enemy). "Friendly Target" is the script for the village people, wich you should avoid shooting, and "Spawner Base" is the script
    for the spawn points used by the village people and the water jars.
  - Interface > "Affect Player" is the interface script used by the water jars (player restores ammo) and village people (player takes damage). "Damageable" is the interface for the enemy.
  - Items > "Water Ammo Base" is the script that manages the player's ammunition adding one when the object gets hit.

Game design and programming: Gabriel Alejandro Crisci (LocalMachine).
